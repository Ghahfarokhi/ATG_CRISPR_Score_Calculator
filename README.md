# CFD Scores Calculator in C++ 
 CFD (Cutting Frequency Determination) score for a given CRISPR guide RNA (crRNA) and DNA sequence is used to estimate the likelihood of a particular guide RNA inducing a double-strand break at a specific genomic targeted by *Streptococcus pyogenes* Cas9 (SpyCas9).

 ### Command line arguments:

 You can run this program in two modes: `singlePair` and `pairList`.

 ### Usage: 
**singlePair**: `./cfdScoresCalculator singlePair <cfdScoresFilePath> <crRNASequence> <DNASequence> `

Example:
```
./cfdScoresCalculator singlePair data/CFD_Scores.txt ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG ACCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG 

output:
0.857143
```

**pairList**: `cfdScoresCalculator pairList <cfdScoresFilePath> <pairListFilePath>`
Example: 

```
./cfdScoresCalculator pairList data/CFD_Scores.txt data/crRNA_DNA_Pair_Examples.txt

output:
crRNA   DNA     CFD
ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG 1
ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG AcCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG 0.857143
ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATtAGG 0.6
ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGa 0.0694444
ATCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG A-CGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG 0.953125
AT-CGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG        ATaCGATGCTGATGCTAGATAAGG        0.727273
```


Note: crRNA and DNA squences must be at least 23 nucleotides or longer and end with their PAMs. 

### Requirements: 
 - **CFD_Scores.txt**: A valid cfdScoreLine in the `CFD_Scores.txt` file is composed of a Label as string and a decimal number as double, in a tab-delimited format (e.g.,: `rU:dG_2   0.857143`). Labels should also include the CFD scores for PAMs. See `data/CFD_Scores.txt` file for details. 
- **crRNA** sequence: case-insensitive letters: A,T/U,C,G,-, 23 nucleotides or longer, ending with PAM. 
- **DNA** sequence: case-insensitive letters: A,T,C,G,-, 23 nucleotides or longer (but must have equal length to crRNA), ending with PAM. 

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Ghahfarokhi/CFD_Scores_Calculator.git
cd CFD_Scores_Calculator
make cfdScoresCalculator
./cfdScoresCalculator -h
```

- *Note*: CFD Scores in the original python code published by Doench J. et al., contained calculation for mismatches only (RNA/DNA bulges were not included). Here, I extracted the CFD scores for DNA and RNA bulges from Supplementary Table 19 and listed them in the `data/CFD_Scores.txt` file. However, it has to be used with cautions as the combination of mismatches and bulges CFD scores is not peer-reviewed, and is vaguely described. The output is identical to the original python code if the provided crRNA and DNA don't contain RNA/DNA bulges.
